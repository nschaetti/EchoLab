2D Acoustic Wave Propagation Simulation with Absorbing Boundary Conditions.

This module implements a finite-difference time-domain scheme for acoustic
wave propagation in heterogeneous media. The numerical recipe follows a
physicist's mindset: we watch the pressure field evolve while damping the
edges to emulate an infinite half-space.
