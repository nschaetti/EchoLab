    "To begin, we should make something about SymPy clear. SymPy is nothing more than a Python library, like `NumPy`, `Django`, or even modules in the Python standard library `sys` or `re`. What this means is that SymPy does not add anything to the Python language. Limitations that are inherent in the Python language are also inherent in SymPy. It also means that SymPy tries to use Python idioms whenever possible, making programming with SymPy easy for those already familiar with programming with Python. As a simple example, SymPy uses Python syntax to build expressions. Implicit multiplication (like 3x or 3 x) is not allowed in Python, and thus not allowed in SymPy. To multiply `3` and `x`, you must type `3*x` with the `*`."

When we created expr, the Python variable `x` was a Symbol. After we created, it, we changed the Python variable x to 2. But expr remains the same. This behavior is not unique to SymPy.

One advantage of using a symbolic computation system like SymPy is that we can build a symbolic representation for expr, and then substitute `x` with values.
